## I will be speaking at Teardown this year!

Have you ever wondered how product teams manage BOMs, revisions, releases, and specifications over the lifecycle of a hardware product?

In this talk, youâ€™ll learn the basics of using Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software with KiCad. I'll walk through how to automatically generate a KiCad database library from part data stored in [Aligni](https://www.aligni.com/), a cloud-based PLM software offering a free tier for open-source hardware organizations.
