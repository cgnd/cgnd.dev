## I'm speaking at KiCon this year!

Have you ever wondered how product teams manage BOMs, revisions, releases, and specifications over the lifecycle of a hardware product?

In this talk, youâ€™ll learn the basics of using Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software with KiCad. I'll walk through how to integrate a KiCad database library with Aligni, a cloud-based PLM software offering a free tier for open-source hardware organizations.
